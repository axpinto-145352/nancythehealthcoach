# Hey Nancy! Your Website Is Live — Here's What to Set Up Next

Hi Nancy! Your website at **nancythehealthcoach.com** is looking great and is live. There are just a few free accounts you need to set up so everything works 100%. I've broken it all down into simple steps below.

Don't worry — none of this is technical. You're basically just creating a few free accounts and sending me some info so I can connect them to your site.

Take your time with these. There's no rush, and you can do them one at a time whenever you have a few minutes.

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- Access to your email: **nancythehealthcoach@gmail.com**
- A computer (some of these are easier on a laptop/desktop than a phone)
- About 30-45 minutes total (you don't have to do it all at once)

## Step 1: Google Search Console

**What this does:** This is how Google knows your website exists. It helps your site show up when people search for things like "brain health coach San Diego" on Google.

**Time:** About 5 minutes

1. Open your browser and go to: **https://search.google.com/search-console**
2. Sign in with your Google account (nancythehealthcoach@gmail.com)
3. You'll see a screen that says "Select property type" — click the right side that says **"URL prefix"**
4. Type in: **https://nancythehealthcoach.com** and click **Continue**
5. A list of verification methods will pop up — look for one called **"HTML tag"** and click on it
6. You'll see a line of code that looks something like this:
   `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="abc123xyz..." />`
7. You only need the part inside the quotes after `content=`. Copy that part (the "abc123xyz..." part)

**Send me:** That code you copied from step 7. Just paste it in a text or email — it'll look like a random string of letters and numbers.

**After I update the site, I'll let you know, and then you'll come back here and:**

8. Click the **"Verify"** button
9. Once verified, look on the left sidebar for **"Sitemaps"**
10. Click on it and type: **sitemap.xml**
11. Click **Submit** — this tells Google about all your pages so it can start showing them in search results

---

## Step 2: Google Analytics

**What this does:** This lets you see how many people visit your website, which pages they look at, how they found you, and more. Think of it like a visitor counter with super detailed info.

**Time:** About 5 minutes

1. Go to: **https://analytics.google.com**
2. Sign in with your Google account (nancythehealthcoach@gmail.com)
3. Click the **"Start measuring"** button
4. For Account name, type: **Nancy The Health Coach**
5. Click **Next**
6. For Property name, type: **nancythehealthcoach.com**
7. Select your time zone and currency (US/USD)
8. Click **Next**
9. For business size, pick **Small** — for industry, pick **Health** (or whatever feels closest)
10. Click **Next**
11. Choose **"Get baseline reports"** or whatever default they suggest, then click **Create**
12. Accept the terms if prompted
13. It will ask you to set up a data stream — choose **Web**
14. For website URL, type: **nancythehealthcoach.com**
15. For stream name, type: **Website**
16. Click **Create stream**
17. You'll now see a **Measurement ID** — it starts with **G-** followed by letters and numbers (like G-ABC123XYZ)

**Send me:** That Measurement ID (the G-XXXXXXXXXX code). That's all I need!

## Step 3: Email Marketing — So You Can Collect Emails

**What this does:** Right now, your site has a signup form for the "7-Day Brain Health Starter Kit" but it's not actually collecting emails yet. You need an email marketing service so that when someone types in their email, it actually goes somewhere and you can send them your starter kit emails.

**Time:** About 10 minutes

**I recommend Kit (formerly ConvertKit)** — it's free for up to 10,000 subscribers and it's built for coaches and creators like you.

1. Go to: **https://kit.com**
2. Click **"Sign up free"**
3. Create an account using your email (nancythehealthcoach@gmail.com)
4. Once you're in, it will walk you through a quick setup — just follow the prompts
5. You'll land on your dashboard
6. On the left sidebar, look for **"Grow"** and then **"Forms"**
7. Don't worry about creating a form here — I just need your account set up

**Later (whenever you're ready):** You'll want to write 7 short emails for your Brain Health Starter Kit — one for each day. Kit makes it easy to set up an email sequence that sends them automatically. I can walk you through that when you're ready, or you can explore it on your own.

**Send me:** Your Kit account email so I can look up the right way to connect your signup form. Or if you see an **API key** anywhere in your account settings, send that too.

## Step 4: Your Social Media Links

**What this does:** Your website footer has icons for Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, but they don't link to anything yet. I need your profile URLs so I can connect them.

**Time:** About 2 minutes (if you already have profiles)

**If you already have profiles:**
Just send me the links! For example:
- Facebook: something like facebook.com/nancythehealthcoach
- Instagram: something like instagram.com/nancythehealthcoach
- LinkedIn: your personal profile link or a business page

**If you don't have a profile on one of these yet:**
That's totally fine! You have two options:
1. Create one when you're ready and send me the link later
2. Tell me which ones you don't want, and I'll remove those icons from the footer

**Send me:** The URL (link) for each social media profile you want on the site. Or let me know which ones to remove.

## Step 5: Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

**What this does:** Since your site collects emails and will have analytics tracking, you're legally required to have a Privacy Policy. It just tells visitors what data you collect and how you use it. The links for these are already in your website footer — they just need the actual content.

**Time:** About 10 minutes

1. Go to: **https://www.termsfeed.com/privacy-policy-generator/**
2. Click **"Start generating"**
3. Answer the questions — here's what to pick:
   - Type of platform: **Website**
   - Website URL: **https://nancythehealthcoach.com**
   - Website name: **Nancy The Health Coach**
   - Country: **United States**
   - State: **California**
   - When it asks what data you collect, check: **Email addresses**
   - When it asks about analytics: **Yes, Google Analytics**
   - When it asks about cookies: **Yes**
4. It will generate a Privacy Policy for you
5. Copy the full text

Then repeat similar steps for a **Terms of Service** (TermsFeed has a generator for that too, or you can skip Terms for now and just do the Privacy Policy — that's the important one).

**Send me:** The full text of your Privacy Policy (and Terms of Service if you made one). Just paste it into an email or doc. I'll create the pages on your site.

## Step 6 (Optional but Recommended): Google Business Profile

**What this does:** This is how you show up on Google Maps and in local search results when someone near San Diego searches for a health coach. It's free and really valuable for getting local clients.

**Time:** About 10 minutes

1. Go to: **https://business.google.com**
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Add your business to Google"**
4. Business name: **Nancy The Health Coach**
5. Business category: search for **Health Coach** (or "Wellness Center" if Health Coach isn't available)
6. When it asks for a location: since you do virtual sessions, you can choose **"I deliver goods and services to my customers"** and set your service area to **San Diego, CA** (and nationwide if you want)
7. Add your contact info:
   - Website: **https://nancythehealthcoach.com**
   - Phone number (if you want it listed)
   - Email
8. Google will verify your business — usually by sending a postcard to your address with a code, or sometimes by phone or email
9. Once verified, you can add your hours, photos, and a description of your services

**Send me:** Nothing! This one is all yours. Once it's set up, it works on its own.

## Step 7: Double-Check Your Calendly

**What this does:** Your Calendly booking link is already on the site and working. Just take a quick minute to make sure everything looks right.

**Time:** 2 minutes

1. Go to: **https://calendly.com/nancythehealthcoach-1/15min**
2. Make sure:
   - Your availability hours are correct
   - The meeting duration is right (currently set to 15 minutes)
   - You're getting email notifications when someone books
   - The time zone is set to your time zone

**Send me:** Nothing unless you want to change the Calendly link or meeting type.

## Quick Summary: What to Send Me

Here's your checklist of everything I need from you. Send these to me whenever you have them — no rush, and you can send them one at a time:

| #  | What to Send Me | From Which Step |
|----|----------------|-----------------|
| 1  | Google Search Console verification code (a string of letters/numbers) | Step 1 |
| 2  | Google Analytics Measurement ID (starts with G-) | Step 2 |
| 3  | Your Kit (email marketing) API key or account email | Step 3 |
| 4  | Your social media profile links (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) — or tell me which to remove | Step 4 |
| 5  | Your Privacy Policy text (and Terms of Service if you made one) | Step 5 |

That's it! Once I have these, I'll get everything hooked up to your site. If you get stuck on any of these steps, just let me know and I'll help you through it.

You're doing great, Nancy!
